# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Project

Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib I have created the following:
    
    1. DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type
    2. Multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type
    
I will use my analysis to summarize how the data differs by city type and make recommendations addressing disparities among the city types.


## Results

The DataFrame below shows rider data based on city type.  The results are expected as Rural has the least number of rides, drivers and total fares. There are less people living in rural areas as well as fewer things to do and places to go.  Conversely, Urban areas have the highest rates of rides, drivers, and fares due to more people living there as well as more places to visit and things to do.

Below is a graph showing total weekly fares for each city type.

## Summary

Below are three recommendations I have based on the ride sharing data.
    
1. There are almost as many drivers in rural areas as there are total rides and there are more drivers than rides in urban areas.  There is way more supply than demand in these areas.  Having drivers focus on suburban areas could increase revenue and help meet demand during peak periods.  
2. There is an uptick in fares toward the end of February.  This could be due to more people utilizing PyBer because of cabin fever from winter.  Adding more drivers during these periods could increase revenue and help meet demand.
3. Incentivize drivers to work in suburban areas by offering bonuses to combat the supply and demand issue listed in recommendation number one.
